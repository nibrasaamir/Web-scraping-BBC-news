This code scrapes articles from the BBC website based on specified keywords using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. 
It employs functions to search for articles, extract their URLs, and scrape content such as title, URL, date, paragraphs, and images. 
The data is then saved to a CSV file. 
Notably, the code lacks IP rotation, a common technique to prevent IP blocking during web scraping. 
Implementing IP rotation involves using a pool of diverse IP addresses for requests, but this was not incorporated due to the challenge of finding reliable and valid IPs. 
While the code successfully extracts and organizes information, considerations for IP rotation are crucial for ethical and uninterrupted web scraping practices.
